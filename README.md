# Rehearsal GitHub Action

Runs Rehearsal Update to keep your TypeScript project ready for the latest TypeScript version. 

The action updates a project code where it's possible and creates tickets (issues) for issues that need engineer interaction.

Learn about [@rehearsal/migrate](https://github.com/rehearsal-js/rehearsal-js/tree/master/packages/migrate) if you want to migrate your project from JavaScript to TypeScript.

# Features

- Opens Tickets (Issues) with suggested code changes have to be made by engineer
- Provides a report in [SARIF](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-tutorials) format compatible with [Checkup](https://checkupjs.github.io/) and [SARIF Viewer for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-SarifVSCode.sarif-viewer)
